## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

# Introduction

# Data Wrangling
## Import data
```{R}
#install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-07-27')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 31)

olympics <- tuesdata$olympics

# Or read in the data manually

olympics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/olympics.csv')
```
## Data wrangling analysis 1 - AC
```{r}
#So the winter and summer were held in the same year up until 1992.
#We are going to look at the data from 1896 - 1992. first we filter
library(dplyr)
subolympics <- olympics %>% filter(year < 1992)
# create data set that sums the countries by year..
countries <- subolympics %>% group_by(year)
countries <- transform(subolympics, countriesnum = ave(seq(nrow(subolympics)), year, FUN = length))
```

## Data wrangling analysis 2 - AC
```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Data wrangling analysis 3 -SG
```{r}
#Are athletes with nicknames more likely to medal in Olympic events?

library(stringr)

#Need to consider the most robust way to filter for nicknames
sub_nickname <- olympics %>% filter(str_detect(name, '"'))
sub_nickname_2 <- olympics %>% filter(str_count(name, '"') == 2 | str_count(name, "'") == 2)

list1 <- unique(sub_nickname$name)
list2 <- unique(sub_nickname_2$name)

difference <- list1[!list1 %in% list2]
difference

#Going with the OR filter
sub_nickname <- sub_nickname_2

```

## Data wrangling analysis 4 - SG
```{r}
# How has participation in track events changed over time? Are athletes competing in fewer events more recently? Has the length of their Olympic careers changed?


```

#Analysis
## Analysis 1 - AC
```{r}
#split the data into two frames summer and winter
```

## Analysis 2 - AC
```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Analysis 3 -SG
```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Analysis 4 - SG
```{r}
1 + 1
```

#Conclusions
