# Introduction

The Olympic games have been a historical icon through the ages. The games represent the best of the best in their given sports. However, the games can sometimes feel out of touch to your average athletic people! As a result, it was our goal to look at the games from a global to personal family level.

## Objectives
-   Evaluate the influence of historical events on the participation level of the games for both males and females
-   Explore how participation in track events has changed over time
-   Determine if the presence of a nickname influences a persons likelihood to medal
-   See how family physical characteristics stack up with olympic medalists through the ages

## Data Wrangling
### Import data & Data set description 

```{R echo=FALSE}
options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)
#install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
library(tidyverse)

olympics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/olympics.csv')
```

#### This dataset contains information about the winter and summer Olympic athletes from the years 1896 to 2016, their team, weight, placing, sport, event, age, height.

-   It was collected from Tidy Tuesday where the data was scraped from www.sports-reference.com.

-   A data dictionary is available on the following slide showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible

## Analyzing the influence of global conflict on male and female participation in the olympic games
-   What we can observe is that global conflicts do influence the level of participation in the games, particularly in the 1900's
-   Female participation may have been less affected by these conflicts
-   The olympics have had steady attendance since the 1990s

## How does participation in Track events change over time?

Let's pull out the track events (removing field!) and add some categories based on this table.
This [wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field) was used to categorize events.

![](Track_Field.png)
---

```{r echo = F}
#Get track and field events
t_f <- olympics %>% filter(sport == "Athletics")
unique(t_f$event) #need to remove vaults, throws, puts, and athalons
track <- t_f %>% filter(!str_detect(event, "Walk|Jump|Put|Throw|Vault|Decathlon|Pentathlon|Heptathlon"))
track <- track %>% filter(!str_detect(event, "Around|Team")) #remove team events, and all-around champ
#unique(track$event)

#Add sub-categories, 60m - 400m sprint, 800m-3000m middle, 5000m-10000m + 5mile + marathon long
track$category <- NA
track$distance <- NA
for (i in 1:nrow(track)) {
  if(str_detect(track$event[i], "Relay")) {
    track$category[i] <- "relay"
  }
  if(str_detect(track$event[i], "Hurdle|Steeplechase")) {
    track$category[i] <- "hurdles"
  }
  if(str_detect(track$event[i], "Marathon|mile|Cross")) {
    track$category[i] <- "long"
  }
  else{
    distance <- str_extract(track$event[i], "\\d+(,\\d{3})*") #regex bad for relay but already categorized above
    track$distance[i] <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", distance))
    if (is.na(track$category[i]) && !is.na(track$distance[i]) && track$distance[i] <= 400) {
      track$category[i] <- "sprint"
    }
    if (is.na(track$category[i]) && !is.na(track$distance[i]) && track$distance[i] > 400 && track$distance[i] <= 3000) {
      track$category[i] <- "middle"
    }
    if (is.na(track$category[i]) && !is.na(track$distance[i]) && track$distance[i] > 3000 && track$distance[i] <= 10000) {
      track$category[i] <- "long"
    }
  }
}

### How do events change over time?

```{r fig.align="center", fig.width=14}
#|echo: false
#|label: Global conflict and olympic participation
#|fig-cap: "Exploring the influence of global conflict on olympic participation for both males and females"
#|warning: FALSE

#How has participation in track events changed over time? 
track %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = reorder(event, year))) + geom_point(na.rm=T) +
  labs(title = "Participation in Track Events Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Event") + theme_minimal()
```

### Are athletes competing in fewer events more recently? 
```{r fig.align="center", fig.width=14}
#|echo: false
#|label: Global conflict and olympic participation
#|fig-cap: "Exploring the influence of global conflict on olympic participation for both males and females"
#|warning: FALSE
track %>% group_by(id, year) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = count, fill = as.factor(year))) + labs(title = "Multiple Event Participation", x = "Year", y = "Number of Events by Althlete") +geom_violin() + theme(legend.position="none")
```

## Olympic Track Trends over time
-   Women's events began in the 1930s
-   Women's 3000m steeplechase is the most recent addition to the field
-   While athletes have always been specialized they recent trend is to participate in fewer events, perhaps as they become more specialized

## We love to give our favorite athletes nicknames, are they more likley to win the olympics if they have one?

We need to figure out if people have nicknames or not, if the althete's name had two " or ', then we assume this indicates their nickname

```{R echo = F}
library(skimr)
olympics_nicknames <- olympics %>% mutate(nickname = as.integer(str_count(name, '"') == 2 | str_count(name, "'") == 2))
olympics_nicknames$nickname <- as.factor(olympics_nicknames$nickname)

nickname <- olympics_nicknames %>% filter(nickname == 1) %>% group_by(medal) %>% summarize(count = n())
no_nickname <- olympics_nicknames %>% filter(nickname == 0) %>% group_by(medal) %>% summarize(count = n())

ggplot(nickname, aes(x = "", y = count, fill = medal)) + coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat="identity") + theme_void()

ggplot(no_nickname, aes(x = "", y = count, fill = medal)) + coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat="identity") + theme_void()

medalcount_nickname <- olympics_nicknames %>% filter(nickname == 1) %>% group_by(name) %>% summarize(Gold = sum(medal == "Gold"), Silver = sum(medal == "Silver"), Bronze = (sum(medal == "Bronze")), None = sum(is.na(medal)))

medalcount_no_nickname <- olympics_nicknames %>% filter(nickname == 0) %>% group_by(name) %>% summarize(Gold = sum(medal == "Gold"), Silver = sum(medal == "Silver"), Bronze = (sum(medal == "Bronze")), None = sum(is.na(medal)))

medalcount_nickname$nickname <- 1
medalcount_no_nickname$nickname <- 0

MergeMedalCount <- rbind(medalcount_nickname, medalcount_no_nickname)

MergeMedalCount_long_noNA <- MergeMedalCount %>% pivot_longer(cols = `Gold`:`None`, names_to = "Medal", values_to = "Count") %>% filter(!Medal == "None", !is.na(Count))

```
---
### It looks like there is a trend but is it statistically different?
```{r echo=FALSE}
str(MergeMedalCount)
summary <- MergeMedalCount %>% group_by(nickname) %>% summarize(gold = sum(Gold, na.rm = T), silver = sum(Silver, na.rm = T), bronze = sum(Bronze, na.rm = T), total = n())

data_matrix <- matrix(c(0, 5697, 4990, 4880, 122342,
                        1, 1219, 804, 722, 12389), ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)

colnames(data_matrix) <- c("nickname", "gold", "silver", "bronze", "total")
rownames(data_matrix) <- c("1", "2")

# Perform the chi-square test
chi_square_result <- chisq.test(data_matrix)

# Print the result
print(chi_square_result)

```
## Shiny application. 

Generally people in families have nicknames. Many are fun and silly. Let's continue that energy.

The goal of this application is to have fun using family members physical characteristics and compare them relative to Olympic athletes who have metaled.

## Inital view of selection page
![](mainopeningpage.png)

## Math for us dummies
![](Mathopening page.png)

## These are the images from the shiny application output. 
-   Richard (Addison's dad) is 6'3", weighs 250, and is 66 years young 

![](RCconversion.jpg) 

## Unfortunately
-   Richard does not have any Olympic counterparts.
 
![](RColympics.jpg) 

## Let's look at Addison's sister Nicole
-   Nicole is 5'5, weighs around 155, and has told her sister she is 29 for the past 8 years.. 
-   Lets look at that age range. 

![](NColympics.jpg) 

## Obervations from application
-   At the age of 37 Nicole would have not have had a counter part. 

## However, within the range of 29 - 37 we have some: 
-   Gold medal cyclist from France 
-   Bronze medal handball player from the UK 
-   Gold medal Judo fighter from France 
-   Gold and silver medal Ice hockey player from Canada 
-   Bronze medal speed skater from China
