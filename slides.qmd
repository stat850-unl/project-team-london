# Introduction

The Olympic games have been a historical icon through the ages. The games represent the best of the best in their given sports. However, the games can sometimes feel out of touch to your average athletic people! As a result, it was our goal to look at the games from a global to personal family level.

## Objectives
-   Evaluate the influence of historical events on the participation level of the games for both males and females
-   Explore how participation in track events has changed over time
-   Determine if the presence of a nickname influences a persons likelihood to medal
-   See how family physical characteristics stack up with olympic medalists through the ages

## Data Wrangling
### Import data & Data set description 

```{R echo=FALSE}
options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)
#install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
library(tidyverse)

olympics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/olympics.csv')
```

#### This dataset contains information about the winter and summer Olympic athletes from the years 1896 to 2016, their team, weight, placing, sport, event, age, height.

-   It was collected from Tidy Tuesday where the data was scraped from www.sports-reference.com.

-   A data dictionary is available on the following slide showing each variable, the type of variable, units, and range of values that are possible

## Analyzing the influence of global conflict on male and female participation in the olympic games
-   What we can observe is that global conflicts do influence the level of participation in the games, particularly in the 1900's
-   Female participation may have been less affected by these conflicts
-   The olympics have had steady attendance since the 1990s

## How does participation in Track events change over time?
#### Data Wrangling: Let's pull out the track events (removing field!)
-   Removed events with that contained "Walk", "Jump", "Throw", and "Team" + more!
-   Now, lets add some categories based on [this table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field)

![](Track_Field.png)
---

```{R echo=FALSE}
#Get track and field events
t_f <- olympics %>% filter(sport == "Athletics")
#unique(t_f$event) #need to remove vaults, throws, puts, and athalons
track <- t_f %>% filter(!str_detect(event, "Walk|Jump|Put|Throw|Vault|Decathlon|Pentathlon|Heptathlon"))
track <- track %>% filter(!str_detect(event, "Around|Team")) #remove team events, and all-around champ
#unique(track$event)

#Add sub-categories, 60m - 400m sprint, 800m-3000m middle, 5000m-10000m + 5mile + marathon long
track$category <- NA
track$distance <- NA
for (i in 1:nrow(track)) {
  if(str_detect(track$event[i], "Relay")) {
    track$category[i] <- "relay"
  }
  if(str_detect(track$event[i], "Hurdle|Steeplechase")) {
    track$category[i] <- "hurdles"
  }
  if(str_detect(track$event[i], "Marathon|mile|Cross")) {
    track$category[i] <- "long"
  }
  else{
    distance <- str_extract(track$event[i], "\\d+(,\\d{3})*") #regex bad for relay but already categorized above
    track$distance[i] <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", distance))
    if (is.na(track$category[i]) && !is.na(track$distance[i]) && track$distance[i] <= 400) {
      track$category[i] <- "sprint"
    }
    if (is.na(track$category[i]) && !is.na(track$distance[i]) && track$distance[i] > 400 && track$distance[i] <= 3000) {
      track$category[i] <- "middle"
    }
    if (is.na(track$category[i]) && !is.na(track$distance[i]) && track$distance[i] > 3000 && track$distance[i] <= 10000) {
      track$category[i] <- "long"
    }
  }
}

### How do events change over time?

```{R fig.align="center", fig.width=14, fig.height=9}
#|echo: false
#|label: Global conflict and olympic participation
#|fig-cap: "Exploring the influence of global conflict on olympic participation for both males and females"
#|warning: FALSE
library(forcats)
library(RColorBrewer)

Fem <- track%>% filter(sex == "F")

track %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = reorder(event, year), color = category)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, na.rm = TRUE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "red", "purple", "green", "blue")) +
  labs(title = "Participation in Track Events Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Event") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 22),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title = element_text(size=24),
        plot.title = element_text(size=28),
        legend.title = element_text(size=24),
        legend.text = element_text(size=16),
        legend.position = "right")
```

## Olympic Track Trends through Time
-   Women's events began in the 1928 while the olypmics have occured since 1896
-   Women's 3000m steeplechase is the most recent addition to the field (2008)
-   Many long distance and hurdle events have been added recently while sprint and relay events have persisted longer

#### We can see how events change but, how has athletes participation changed with time?
---
### Are athletes competing in fewer events more recently? 
```{r fig.align="center", fig.width=14, fig.height=9}
#|echo: false
#|label: Global conflict and olympic participation
#|fig-cap: "Exploring the influence of global conflict on olympic participation for both males and females"
#|warning: FALSE
track %>% 
  group_by(id, year) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = count, fill = as.factor(year))) + 
  labs(title = "Multiple Event Participation", x = "Year", y = "Number of Events by Althlete") +
  geom_violin() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 22),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 16),
      axis.title = element_text(size=24),
      plot.title = element_text(size=24),

      legend.text = element_text(size=16),
      legend.position="none")
```

## Olympic Athlete Specailization through Time
-   Track athletes participate in 1-5 events during an Olympics
-   The number of events done by athletes has always been low but there is a trend towards competing in fewer events
-   It appears that athlete specialization is increasing or events are becoming more competitive!

#### We all know how competative the track events are and cheer for our favorites, even giving them nicknames!

## Do these beloved athletes with nicknames win more often?

#### Data Wrangling: We need to figure out if althetes have nicknames or not
-   Lets go back to all athlete for this analysis
-   When the athlete's name had two " or ', then we assume this indicates their nickname
-   9.2% of all athletes had a nickname 

```{R echo = FALSE}
library(skimr)
olympics_nicknames <- olympics %>% mutate(nickname = as.integer(str_count(name, '"') == 2 | str_count(name, "'") == 2))
olympics_nicknames$nickname <- as.factor(olympics_nicknames$nickname)

olympics_nicknames %>% group_by(nickname) %>% summarize(count = n(), percent = n()/nrow(olympics_nicknames))
```

## Medal Counts for Athletes 
```{R echo = FALSE}
#install.packages("cowplot")
library(cowplot)

nickname <- olympics_nicknames %>% filter(nickname == 1) %>% group_by(medal) %>% summarize(count = n())
no_nickname <- olympics_nicknames %>% filter(nickname == 0) %>% group_by(medal) %>% summarize(count = n())

nickname$medal <- factor(nickname$medal, levels = c("gold", "silver", "bronze", "no_medal"))

p1 <- ggplot(nickname, aes(x = "", y = count)) +
  labs(title = "Athletes with Nicknames") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", fill = c("gold", "#cd7f32", "#808080", "lightblue")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
        legend.position = 'none') +
  theme_void()

no_nickname$medal <- factor(no_nickname$medal, levels = c("gold", "silver", "bronze", "no_medal"))

p2 <- ggplot(no_nickname, aes(x = "", y = count)) +
  labs(title = "Athletes with Nicknames") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", fill = c("gold", "#cd7f32", "#808080", "lightblue")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20),
        legend.position = 'none') +
  theme_void()

plot_grid(p1,p2, labels = c("",""))

medalcount_nickname <- olympics_nicknames %>% filter(nickname == 1) %>% group_by(name) %>% summarize(Gold = sum(medal == "Gold"), Silver = sum(medal == "Silver"), Bronze = (sum(medal == "Bronze")), None = sum(is.na(medal)))

medalcount_no_nickname <- olympics_nicknames %>% filter(nickname == 0) %>% group_by(name) %>% summarize(Gold = sum(medal == "Gold"), Silver = sum(medal == "Silver"), Bronze = (sum(medal == "Bronze")), None = sum(is.na(medal)))

medalcount_nickname$nickname <- 1
medalcount_no_nickname$nickname <- 0

MergeMedalCount <- rbind(medalcount_nickname, medalcount_no_nickname)

MergeMedalCount_long_noNA <- MergeMedalCount %>% pivot_longer(cols = `Gold`:`None`, names_to = "Medal", values_to = "Count") %>% filter(!Medal == "None", !is.na(Count))

```
---
### It looks like atletes with nicknames win more frequently, lets test for it!
-   Lets build a table and perform a chi-square test for independence

| Nickname | Gold | Silver | Bronze | No Medal |
|----------|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Yes      | 5697 | 4900   | 4880   | 106775   |
| No       | 1219 | 804    | 722    | 9644     |

```{r echo=FALSE}
#str(MergeMedalCount)
summary <- MergeMedalCount %>% group_by(nickname) %>% summarize(gold = sum(Gold, na.rm = T), silver = sum(Silver, na.rm = T), bronze = sum(Bronze, na.rm = T), total = n())

data_matrix <- matrix(c(0, 5697, 4990, 4880, 106775,
                        1, 1219, 804, 722, 9644), ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)

colnames(data_matrix) <- c("nickname", "gold", "silver", "bronze", "total")
rownames(data_matrix) <- c("1", "2")

# Perform the chi-square test
chi_square_result <- chisq.test(data_matrix)

# Print the result
print(chi_square_result)

#could look at residuals to see what deviates from expected but I think this is fine. 

```
## Shiny application. 

Generally people in families have nicknames. Many are fun and silly. Let's continue that energy.

The goal of this application is to have fun using family members physical characteristics and compare them relative to Olympic athletes who have metaled.

## Let's look at Addison's sister Nicole
-   Nicole is 5'5, weighs around 155, and has told her sister she is 29 for the past 8 years.. 
-   Lets look at that age range.
